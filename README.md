# coursera-server-side-development
I have made the following project as a part of the following course on Backend Developemnt: https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs/home/welcome
The project is a restarant menu app, where users can log in (authentication) using either their email ids or their google account, view dishes, add/edit comments. The app also has functionality for an admin user who can create dishes or make other users admin. There is also functionality to upload image files.
